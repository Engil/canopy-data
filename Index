We're in Marrakesh at [Priscilla](http://queenofthemedina.com/en/index.html) working on [MirageOS](https://mirage.io).

There is code of this webservice, [canopy](https://github.com/Engil/canopy).
Feel free to add content (by creating a file in [this
repository](https://github.com/hannesm/canopy-data)).

Project ideas at [Pioneer Projects](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects) and [elsewhere](https://github.com/mirage/marrakech2016/wiki/Potential-Projects)

We hang out in the sun and on IRC in `#mirage` (`irc.freenode.net`).

Lunch at 2, dinner at 7.  Water behind the counter, fruits on the counter.  Help yourself.

We need to clean the dishes after lunch and dinner ourselves.  Please organise.
