We're in Marrkesh at [Priscilla](http://queenofthemedina.com/en/index.html) working on [MirageOS](https://mitage.io).

There is code of this webservice, [canopy](https://github.com/Engil/canopy).
Feel free to add content (by creating a file in [this
repository](https://github.com/hannesm/canopy-data).

Project ideas at [Pioneer Projects](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects) and [elsewhere](https://github.com/mirage/marrakech2016/wiki/Potential-Projects)

Lunch at 2, dinner at 7.  Water behind the counter, fruits on the counter.  Help yourself.

We need to clean the dishes after lunch and dinner ourselves.  Please organise.
