This is a small MirageOS webservice, using [canopy](https://github.com/Engil/Canopy).
Feel free to add content (by creating a file in [this repository](https://github.com/hannesm/canopy-data)).

We'll soon (on July 13th) be in Cambridge (Darwin College) for a single day of working on MirageOS.

**Proposed projects:**

  * Solo5/unikernel/Mirage integration
  * NickB would like to work on uboot+ocaml+mirage for the Pine64
  * Qi Li - might demo his unikernel with tls for ARM cubietruck
  * it would be lovely to have a PR for [package version constraints in the mirage tool](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/392)

**Docker:**

  * Dave wants to work on VPNkit/Windows/Mirage via a new Lwt engine that is Windows friendly
  * ThomasG/L and the interns and Anil will continue to make progress on the CI system, tailored for Mirage
  * IanC has been helping retire mirage-xen-arm-builder in favour of an Alpine/Moby-based ARM distro, which now works on the Cubieboards.
  * Mindy (yomimono) will be working to merge your PRs for 3.0 :)

**Schedule for hackathon day/evening:**

Richard King room at Darwin College
* 9am start - 11pm finish
