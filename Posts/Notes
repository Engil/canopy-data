abstract: Collecting all the notes from hackathon attendees

I was enjoying the first MirageOS hackathon from Cambridge by reading the IRC
updates, and following everyoneâ€™s tweets and messages. It sounds like it was
thoroughly enjoyed by all, and was a great combination of fun and productivity
- and sun!

* [Raw notes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/activity/wiki/MirageOS-Hackathon)
  from the IRC and a round-up of posts made during the hackathon are up -
  please edit as appropriate. The progressively tagine-smeared notes were an
  interesting challenge :)

* Please send photos you are willing to share from the hackathon to me via
  DropBox (gemma.t.gordon@gmail.com).

* As Hannes has already mentioned - feedback and thoughts on what worked well
  and ideas for our next hackathon are greatly encouraged. Add them here, or
  via the [mailing list](mailto:mirageos-devel@lists.xenproject.org).
