## Change to `nuc1 wifi`

Network `nuc1 wifi` is running [charrua dhcp server](http://github.com/haesbaert/charrua-core) 
as an unikernel, we had problems with the hostel router and everyone should
change to `nuc1 wifi`.

This is one of the few oportunities I get to test the dhcp library in a larger
environment, so by using it, you're already contributing to mirage. The larger
the user base and user cases, more bugs we find, so far we've found none, which
is cool too.

If you run into any issues just come and kick me hard, even if I'm sleeping,
seriously.

You can check the console output by connecting to `192.168.1.37` and `xl
console dhcp`.
