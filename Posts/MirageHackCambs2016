  * NickB would like to work on uboot+ocaml+mirage for the Pine64
  * New ARM distribution based on Alpine (Ian Campbell / Anil) that includes Xen and KVM (for an eventual Solo5 port)
  * Qi Li - might demo his unikernel with tls for ARM cubietruck
  * it would be lovely to have a PR for [package version constraints in the mirage tool](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/392)
  * Test out OCaml 4.04 new features: e.g. [LTO](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/608)
  * Remove pre-functoria hacks from mirage front-end tool (side effect: [fix error messages!](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/461)

  * [Dave Scott] wants to work on VPNkit/Windows/Mirage via a new Lwt engine that is Windows friendly
  * ThomasG/L and the interns and Anil will continue to make progress on the CI system, tailored for Mirage
