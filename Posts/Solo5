### Preparation for and upstreaming of Mirage/Solo5

(This section is also copied to the Github tracking issue at djwillia/solo5#36)

1. Decide on repository naming and ownership. We have a bunch of repos that are Solo5 specific. Should we move them into a `solo5/` org or into `mirage/`. Decision: move into `mirage/` since they are parallels to the existing `xen` and `unix` variant repositories that are already there.

  Overall picture of repository/opam/org relationships:

  ````
OPAM package            Git repository (current)          Git repository (upstream)

mirage                  djwillia/mirage#solo5             mirage/mirage (upstream via pr)
mirage-solo5            djwillia/mirage-platform#solo5    
                            >> djwillia/mirage-solo5          mirage/mirage-solo5
mirage-block-solo5      djwillia/mirage-block-solo5       mirage/mirage-block-solo5
mirage-net-solo5        djwillia/mirage-net-solo5         mirage/mirage-net-solo5
mirage-bootvar-solo5    djwillia/mirage-bootvar-solo5     mirage/mirage-bootvar-solo5
mirage-console          djwillia/mirage-console#solo5
>> mirage-console-solo5 >> djwillia/mirage-console-solo5  mirage/mirage-console-solo5
mirage-entropy-solo5    mato/mirage-entropy#solo5         TBD, need to discuss with @hannesm
nocrypto                mato/ocaml-nocrypto#solo5         TBD, need to discuss with @hannesm
ocaml-freestanding      mato/ocaml-freestanding           mirage/ocaml-freestanding
solo5-kernel-ukvm       djwillia/solo5                    leave as is
solo5-kernel-virtio     djwillia/solo5                    leave as is
gmp-freestanding        - (opam only)                     -
zarith-freestanding     - (opam only)                     -
-                       djwillia/opam-solo5               leave as is

(>> means needs to be renamed)

2. Clean up package and repository relationships based on above:
  - [x] Extricate `mirage-solo5` from `mirage-platform` fork.
  - [x] Extricate `mirage-console-solo5` from `mirage-console` fork.
  - [x] Email Github support to convert forks to normal repositories.
  - [ ] Once Github "unforks" the requested repositories, transfer them to Mirage org on Github.

4. Publish the `mirage-solo5*` packages to `opam.ocaml.org`.
  - [ ] Clean up `opam` files for these packages (correct maintainer, repo URLs, ...)
  - [ ] Cut releases of each package that will be published.
  - [ ] @mato to Figure out with @hannesm what to do about `mirage-entropy-solo5` and `nocrypto` to avoid any code duplication here.

5. Mirage frontend changes.
  - [ ] Submit PR for merging Mirage frontend changes from `djwillia/mirage#solo5`
into `mirage/mirage`.

### Specialization of ukvm binary for the built unikernel

- Discussed with Jeremy Yallop and Thomas Gazagnaire how to get the relevant information for ukvm out of Mirage/Functoria. Current plan is to just trawl
  through `libraries` looking for `mirage-net-solo5`, `mirage-block-solo5`. Eventually (to support multiple instances of devices) we will query the dependency graph proper.
- Discussed with Dan Williams how to implement the integration between the mirage-generated unikernel `Makefile` and the ukvm build system. Plan is to have a `ukvm-configure` tool which generates a `Makefile.ukvm`, this gets included by the unikernel Makefile.
