title: Releasing PPX libraries for Mirage core

abstract: Making Mirage core ppx based and improving Windows support

I've been going through all the core libraries in Mirage and refreshing them to:

- add Appveyor support based on the [ocaml-ci-scripts](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-ci-scripts) so that we test the libraries on Windows
- removing the use of camlp4 and using ppx, mainly in cstruct and lwt.

Major libraries I did this for include:
- [mirage-profile](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5976)
- [dns](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5971)
- [shared-memory-ring](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5986) and [1.3.0](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/6051)
- [xenstore](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5992)
- [mirage-platform](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/6045)
- [vmnet](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/6053)
- [tcpip](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/6092)
- [mirage-block-unix](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5890)

And also added lots of upper bounds to [older packages](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/5992) with the top of cstruct.
