This page lists the nicest stacktraces produced by Mirage during the hackathon.

- When contacting the gateway (`10.0.0.1`) to reach a dns resolver `8.8.8.8`:

  ```
  ARP: retrying 10.0.0.1 (n=3)
  ARP: transmitting probe -> 10.0.0.1
  IP.output: arp timeout to gw 8.8.8.8
  Fatal error: exception Ipv4.Make(Ethif)(Arpv4).Routing.No_route_
  ```

  In the error message, it looks like the gw is set to `8.8.8.8`.

- Syntax Error in your config.ml leads to:

  ```
  $ mirage configure --unix --net=socket
  mirage: unknown option `--unix'.
  Usage: mirage configure [OPTION]...
  Try `mirage configure --help' or `mirage --help' for more information.
  ```

- While running Canopy on Unix, while syncing the repository using Irmin:

  ```
  Fatal error: exception Unix.Unix_error(Unix.EINVAL, "select", "")
  Raised by primitive operation at file "src/unix/lwt_engine.ml", line 371, characters 26-60
  Called from file "src/unix/lwt_engine.ml", line 312, characters 8-39
  Called from file "src/unix/lwt_main.ml", line 41, characters 8-82
  Called from file "main.ml", line 185, characters 5-10
  ```
