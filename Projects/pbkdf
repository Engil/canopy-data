Over the last few days we have been working on password based key derivation functions as defined by [PKCS#5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898) over [nocrypto](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto).

We are happy to announce the release of [ocaml-pbkdf](https://github.com/abeaumont/ocaml-pbkdf) 0.1.0, supporting both PBKDF1 and PBKDF2.
You can install it with `opam install pbkdf` and give it a try.
