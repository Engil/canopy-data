## Description

NetHSM is an software-based HSM unikernel application based on
MirageOS, cohttp, nocrypto, webmachine and yojson.  It is accessed
trough a simple JSON REST-API and is designed for running on
dedicated appliances (x86/ARM) or as cloud instances (with impaired
security).

The project will comprise the unikernel application with a JSON based
REST-API, a command line utility, and libraries (PKCS#11/JCE) that
will access the REST-API as a backend.
