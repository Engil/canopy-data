[SSH](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251) is a common protocol used for secure shell access to remote machines. It would be very useful to have an implementation for Mirage, enabling unikernels to provide simple, secure command-line access. An early implementation by @avsm exists at @avsm/ocaml-ssh but requires considerable updating: swapping out `ounix` for `Lwt`, removing the MPL extensions in favour of `Cstruct`, using modules in preference to objects, and a number of other items.
