[QubesOS][] is a desktop operating system that runs applications in different Linux VMs for added security. [mirage-firewall][] can be used to provide firewalling, routing and NAT for the application VMs.
There are lots of ways this could be extended: see [A Unikernel Firewall for QubesOS][] for some suggestions.
