*Status:* running, syslog-reporter would be nice

[Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) is a standard protocol used to convey event notification messages. It would be nice to have a unikernel that could act as a `syslogd` receiver. The unikernel would listen appropriately (initially in cleartext though SSL/TLS support is also desirable), receive and verify syslog messages, and then write them into an Irmin store.
