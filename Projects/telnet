Telnet - TERminal over NETwork - describes NVT (network virtual terminal) and
operations on it.  It allows a local client to access a remote terminal
interface.

I've heard that unikernels are hard to debug and inspect; also I used a lisp
machine toplevel (see [this video](https://vimeo.com/159946178)) and worked (a
decade ago) on an interactive shell for a network stack (see [this
code](https://github.com/dylan-hackers/network-night-vision/blob/master/gui-sniffer/commands.dylan))
(and screenshots, etc. in the same repository) -- inspired by Cisco IOS / CatOS
/ Juniper shells.

David implemented a [nice tty library](https://github.com/pqwy/notty) in OCaml,
which I want to use to develop an interactive adventure game ^W^Wshell for
MirageOS.  A telnet server will be a backend of notty (David already did a
mirage branch on notty which defines the interface), the application will be
something very similar to [ocamlnat](http://benediktmeurer.de/ocamlnat/).

You are concerned about security?  Well, maybe talk telnet over TLS (and use
X.509 client certificates) :) (a `openssl s_client -key mykey.pem -cert
mycert.pem -connect mirage | telnet` should be sufficient)

Why not SSH?  Oh, I'd love to have ssh in pure OCaml, but that'll take some
months (I don't know much of the protocol).  Anil wrote a [partial, slightly
bitrot ssh](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-ssh/) several years ago (which is
a good starting point for volunteers who want to implement ssh).

Current status: partially working telnet implementation (on my hard disk) which
correctly transmits window size changes and redraws screens, not yet any access
control library or shell.  I'm lazy (or overloaded with projects) and needed to
enjoy the sun and chats with friends in Marrakesh.
